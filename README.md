# Daily Logs

This repo contains my daily notes in Markdown format. I started keeping daily running log of things I have done for myself (almost as a personal quick memory cache), and for daily agile stand ups. I have redacted private information from these notes using `**redacted**`, but mostly they are intact. Almost every task is tagged with its type, the valid tags are below:
- `@example` created to show a concept or for documentation, like [cypress-example-kitchensink](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-example-kitchensink) and [cypress-example-recipes](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-example-recipes). I also tag most of the work related to the documentation with `@example` because our docs do have lots of examples.
- `@feature` is the new code or fixing bugs or writing tests or documenting new feature
- `@internal` are utility tasks that are usually private to Cypress
- `@support` supporting our users
- `@slides` preparing for a public presentation, working on slides, sending a proposal
- `@presentation` the actual public presentation in front of people
- `@learning` is when I was learning something new
- `@hiring` working to hire someone
- `@blog` writing a blog post for [https://www.cypress.io/blog/](https://www.cypress.io/blog/), [https://glebbahmutov.com/blog/](https://glebbahmutov.com/blog/), or some 3rd party blog

The dates follow YYYY-MM-DD format, for example `2020-05-27`. There are a couple of missing days - I was probably taking time off or traveling. You often find "The Weekend" notes that show me working through the weekend. I only do this because I enjoy my work so so much, it helps me to do stuff even during my days off. Usually during the weekends I invent new stuff, prepare presentations, and write blog posts.
