# Daily Logs

This repo contains my daily notes in Markdown format. I started keeping daily running log of things I have done for myself (almost my a quick memory cache), and for daily agile stand ups. I have redacted private information from these notes using `**redacted**`, but mostly they are intact. Almost every task is tagged with its type, the valid tags are below:
- `@example` created to show a concept or for documentation, like [cypress-example-kitchensink](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-example-kitchensink) and [cypress-example-recipes](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-example-recipes). I also tag any work related to the documentation with `@example`
- `@feature` is the new code or fixing bugs or writing tests
- `@internal` are utility tasks that are usually private to Cypress
- `@support` private help to users
- `@presentation` is for working on the slides or making a presentation
- `@learning` is when I was learning something new
- `@hiring` conducting a hiring interview
- `@blog` writing a blog post for [https://www.cypress.io/blog/](https://www.cypress.io/blog/) or [https://glebbahmutov.com/blog/](https://glebbahmutov.com/blog/)

The dates follow YYYY-MM-DD format, for example `2020-05-27`
