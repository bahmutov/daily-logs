- answer **redacted** about assignment @hiring
- **redacted** presentation @presentation
  - - could you explain in detail the difference between app actions versus the page object model? https://www.cypress.io/blog/2019/01/03/stop-using-page-objects-and-start-using-app-actions/#persistance-example

  - Could you explain how when setting the application state with the window object makes the app more testable? Why not just use cypress commands rather than creating window objects?

  - could you show what the dashboard reporting looks like? and how paid features like parallelization speed up the testing process? how does this work with a Jenkins setup?



  - https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/281 what is the status of the removing mocha from cypress and allowing different test adapters like jest?



  - is there an ideal pattern when structuring test files? having all page actions contained in a single file, versus breaking up these test cases in multiple files? what about going in the extreme and having a new file for every assertion? are such measures worthwhile in speeding up test times if you can't parallelize?



  - what is the preferred strategy to deal with authentication (MS Azure OpenId Connect) with Cypress? Mocking the request or creating a token to save in local storage?
